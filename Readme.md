## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd controlbackend
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Server

To start the server in development mode with `nodemon` (which will automatically restart on code changes):

```bash
npm run server
```

To start the server normally:

```bash
npm start
```

### Building the Project

To build the TypeScript files into JavaScript:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Scripts

- `npm run server`: Starts the server in development mode with `nodemon`.
- `npm run start`: Starts the server with `ts-node` (useful for running in production after building).
- `npm run build`: Compiles TypeScript files into JavaScript.
